# Rock Paper Scissors Game

About
-------
* This is my week 3 challenge at Makers Academy
* I have made a Rock Paper Scissors game which can be played against a computer player.

## Basic Rules

- Rock beats Scissors
- Scissors beats Paper
- Paper beats Rock

Task
----

The Makers Academy Marketing Array ( **MAMA** ) have asked us to provide a game for them. Their daily grind is pretty tough and they need time to steam a little.

Your task is to provide a _Rock, Paper, Scissors_ game for them so they can play on the web with the following user stories:

```
As a marketeer
So that I can see my name in lights
I would like to register my name before playing an online game

As a marketeer
So that I can enjoy myself away from the daily grind
I would like to be able to play rock/paper/scissors
```

Functionality:
- the marketeer should be able to enter their name before the game
- the marketeer will be presented the choices (rock, paper and scissors)
- the marketeer can choose one option
- the game will choose a random option
- a winner will be declared

Technologies used
-----------------

* Ruby 2.2.3
* Sinatra framework
* Testing - Rspec Sinatra for unit testing and Capybara for feature tests

Yet to do
---------
Implement a two player game.
